Fueled by best-in-class data and innovative technology we help businesses make smarter decisions, identify consumers, make decisions on loans, market to prospects and collect. Job Description Experian Consumer Services – Careers That Define “What’s the Next Big (Data) Thing” for Consumers? What could be more exciting – personally and professionally – than being part of a “disruptive” business? Consider taking your career to the next level by joining the Leader that continues to disrupt the competition. As the “disruptor” and market leader we pride ourselves on building new markets, leading the pack through continuous evolution and innovation. It’s a position Experian Consumer Services has enjoyed for more than a decade and we’re always looking for the talent that can help expand that lead. These days, the “next big thing” is often “the next Big Data thing.” Experian Consumer Services offers an opportunity to lead the charge in turning consumer data into something people use and value every single day. We live in a world where information is a means to improving lives and we challenge our team to do just that: improve lives with our products. As a senior member of the Application Operations Team, your initial task will be to understand application architecture, provide observability, identify efficiency and stability solutions, and drive resolution for a subset of Experian Consumer Service’s 24/7 SaaS applications. You’ll be embedded in various development teams to understand how the system is changing while acquiring the necessary domain knowledge to effectively troubleshoot and repair an outage. This information will be used to coordinate with Operations, Security, and Quality Assurance teams, among others, to raise awareness and increase stability. This position requires a holistic approach to troubleshooting and an innate need to optimize, harden, and automate tasks to prevent and recover from outages or other customer issues. Responsibilities What you’ll be doing: Able to work independently and offer insights and analysis on existing codebase. Performance considerations are second nature.

About Very Very is a fully distributed IoT technology firm led by expert problem-solvers to create efficient, scalable solutions that move commercial, industrial, and consumer IoT projects from pilot to production in record time. We’ve built a collaborative, tight-knit team that thrives, whether we’re hanging out in person at our annual retreat or coordinating work across time zones. The results show that we’re doing something right — as we’ve won numerous workplace awards over the years. Most recently in 2021 we were certified as a Great Place to Work, and in 2022 we were listed again in Parity.org’s list of Best Companies for Women to Advance. We believe that everything we build — and the people we build it with — has the potential to change the world. Our client list includes numerous well-known brands determined to leverage the power of IoT to drive material outcomes — such as Vizio, Peloton, Clear, iHeart Radio and Fellowes. Our goal, for each and every client we partner with, is to create high-value solutions through a collaborative and user-centered process. About This Role As a Generalist Lead Data Scientist at Very, you will work with our Software, Hardware, and Product Design teams to build full-service solutions for our clients. We focus on building end-to-end hardware and software solutions that meet our client's business needs, and reliable machine learning systems are often a part of our offering. An ideal candidate will display technical expertise in machine learning and data science, as well as strong communication skills, and the ability to present ideas and results to audiences ranging in technical depth. Candidates should also have experience translating business problems into analytical solutions, working in interdisciplinary teams, and building ML models for production systems. What You’ll Be Working On At Very, there is a never-ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. However, it is critical to note that almost all of these projects are production systems. As such, the only consistent research component of this position will revolve around establishing a pattern of delivery that allows the team to implement full-scale applications leveraging machine learning in a fast, predictable manner. You’ll spend 80-90% of your time working on products or platforms for one of our clients, and the other 10-20% of your time will be spent improving Very’s Data Science Practice. This will involve:  Working with other data scientists to continuously improve our delivery process for data science applications  Working with our marketing team to generate high-quality content (blog posts, conference presentations)  Working with our sales team to close deals and build meaningful, well-scoped proposals for potential clients As a lead data scientist, you will be expected to not only understand the following analytical approaches but also be able to guide others in their implementation:  Predictive modeling and/or anomaly detection on multivariate time series data  State classification and prediction for geospatial time series data  Regression and classification using a variety of deep learning and ensemble tree-based methods  Clustering/segmentation  Dimensionality reduction or latent space representation  Classical statistical analysis and signal processing Our Current Tooling Our data science contracts typically involve building a greenfield API or greenfield product from the ground up. In the context of the data science and machine learning pipelines, we typically leverage:  Git, GitHub, CircleCI or GitHub Actions (CI/CD), pytest (TDD)  The standard SciPy Stack (Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)  SQL/Postgres  Docker  Jupyter notebooks for prototyping  Cloud architecture and resources for production systems. eg)  AWS: Lambda, ECR/ECS, RDS, API Gateway, Batch, Sagemaker  Azure: Functions, Container Registry/Instances, SQL Database [for PostgreSQL/MySQL], API Management, Machine Learning  3rd party: TimescaleDB  Serverless or Terraform for Infrastructure-as-Code  MLflow  PyTorch On our full-service builds, we often reach for the following tools. Experience with them is not required, but any familiarity with these tools is a plus. Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here:  Python web development frameworks (Django, Flask)  React & React Native  Swift & Objective C  Ruby on Rails As an IoT technology company our data science pipelines include “Things”. This will require you to build pipelines and deploy analytical models to hardware on the edge in addition to the cloud. This requires a deep collaboration with the design, software and hardware teams in the following environments:  Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves  Embedded C and other lower level languages such as Rust  CI/CD including hardware and end-to-end testing and verification  Development Single-Board Computers such as RPi At Very we have two types of lead positions; a specialist and generalist. Both positions go beyond the mastery of the core Data Science competencies to include a leadership position.

Professional development funds and generous parental leave are also some of the benefits you can expect. But a healthy company culture isn't just about perks. It's about creating an environment where our employees can thrive. Our work is fueled by smart, creative people whose lives are enriched by our experiences together. We learn together, we grow together, and we play together.

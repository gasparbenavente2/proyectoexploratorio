About Our Client Web3 is a 10x improvement in content monetization and NFTs enable new form of creator-fan connection akin to “digital merch”. Our mission is to make web3 more accessible by building the most familiar tool we know today: a social app. We believe that web3 is uniquely suited to improve social networks:  In web2, algorithms benefit platforms: social media giants maximize ""time spent browsing,"" and would rather show you cat videos or controversial takes if it means more ad revenue. Everyone is connected, but engagement is superficial.   In web3, creators and their communities are at the forefront: web3 opens up opportunities to sell digital goods to fans and for platforms to take a small fee. Our incentive is for creators to live off their passion. It's a win-win.  We are starting with web3-native music artists. We also believe that novel primitives like digital collectibles, token-gated group chats, and social tokens are features that will reinvent social networks in that direction.  Your day-to-day role  We’re looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to ship web3 features in collaboration with our 2 other backend engineers and 3 frontend engineers.
